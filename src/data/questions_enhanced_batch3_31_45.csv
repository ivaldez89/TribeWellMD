Chest radiograph shows hyperinflation without infiltrate.

In addition to bronchodilators and systemic glucocorticoids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?","[{""label"": ""A"", ""text"": ""Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation""}, {""label"": ""B"", ""text"": ""Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation""}, {""label"": ""C"", ""text"": ""High-flow nasal cannula at 60 L/min""}, {""label"": ""D"", ""text"": ""Immediate bronchoscopy to clear secretions""}, {""label"": ""E"", ""text"": ""Inhaled corticosteroids only and discharge""}]",B,"Pathophysiology: Acute COPD exacerbations can cause worsening ventilation-perfusion mismatch and alveolar hypoventilation, leading to hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) improves alveolar ventilation, decreases work of breathing, and reduces the need for intubation.

Correct Answer Rationale: He has an acute COPD exacerbation with respiratory acidosis (pH 7.28) and hypercapnia (PaCO2 68) despite supplemental oxygen. NIV is indicated in COPD exacerbations with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure to improve gas exchange and reduce intubation risk.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Intubation is indicated if NIV fails, the patient cannot protect the airway, has severe hemodynamic instability, or has worsening mental status; NIV is appropriate first here.
- Option B (Correct): NIV is first-line for COPD exacerbation with hypercapnic respiratory acidosis.
- Option C: High-flow nasal cannula can improve oxygenation but does not reliably correct hypercapnic acidosis as effectively as NIV in COPD.
- Option D: Bronchoscopy is not routine for COPD exacerbations without evidence of obstruction/foreign body.
- Option E: This patient is acidotic and somnolent; discharge is unsafe and inhaled steroids alone are inadequate.

Clinical Pearl: COPD exacerbation with pH <7.35 and elevated PaCO2 is an indication for noninvasive ventilation unless contraindicated.",premature_closure

Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state due to increased clotting factors and venous stasis.

Correct Answer Rationale: She has high suspicion for PE (pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, unilateral leg symptoms) and a normal chest radiograph. In pregnancy with a normal CXR, a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is often preferred to minimize maternal breast radiation while providing high diagnostic yield.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: CTPA is appropriate if the chest radiograph is abnormal or V/Q is nondiagnostic, but it exposes maternal breast tissue to higher radiation.
- Option B (Correct): With normal CXR in pregnancy, V/Q scan is an appropriate next test for suspected PE.
- Option C: D-dimer rises physiologically in pregnancy and is less useful; high suspicion warrants imaging.
- Option D: PFTs do not diagnose acute PE.
- Option E: Stress echo is not used for acute PE diagnosis.

Correct Answer Rationale: She has preeclampsia with severe features (severe-range BP, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, neurologic symptoms). Magnesium sulfate is indicated for seizure prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Corticosteroids may be given if earlier gestation, but they do not address maternal seizure risk and should not delay definitive management.
- Option B (Correct): Magnesium sulfate is first-line for seizure prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia.
- Option C: Iron does not address acute hypertensive emergency or seizure risk.
- Option D: Tocolysis is contraindicated in severe preeclampsia.
- Option E: Severe features at 35 weeks require stabilization and delivery planning; waiting increases maternal/fetal risk.

Management is maternal stabilization (including magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis) and expedited delivery, regardless of gestational age.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: RUQ pain is from hepatic involvement, not gallbladder disease; surgery delays definitive treatment.
- Option B (Correct): HELLP requires stabilization and delivery to prevent progression.
- Option C: Ursodeoxycholic acid treats intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, which presents with pruritus and mild LFT elevation.
- Option D: Outpatient management is unsafe in HELLP.

Digital cervical examination can disrupt placental attachment and precipitate massive hemorrhage.

Correct Answer Rationale: Ultrasound confirms placenta previa and the patient is hemodynamically stable with reassuring fetal status. The next step is to avoid digital vaginal examination and manage expectantly (pelvic rest, monitoring, and planning cesarean delivery at appropriate gestational age or sooner if bleeding is severe).

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Digital exam is contraindicated in placenta previa due to risk of hemorrhage.
- Option B: Vaginal delivery induction is contraindicated when placenta covers the os.
- Option C (Correct): Stable placenta previa is managed with pelvic rest and planned cesarean delivery; avoid digital exams.
- Option D: Methylergonovine is used for uterine atony postpartum, not antepartum bleeding from previa.
- Option E: Amniotomy is not appropriate and can worsen bleeding.

When beta-hCG is near the discriminatory zone and no intrauterine pregnancy is visualized, the pregnancy location is unknown and requires close follow-up.

Correct Answer Rationale: With beta-hCG around the discriminatory threshold and no intrauterine pregnancy seen, this is a pregnancy of unknown location. The appropriate next step is serial beta-hCG measurement and repeat transvaginal ultrasound to distinguish early intrauterine pregnancy from ectopic pregnancy or early pregnancy loss.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Absence of an intrauterine pregnancy at this beta-hCG level raises concern for ectopic pregnancy.
- Option B: Methotrexate is used for confirmed or strongly suspected ectopic pregnancy in stable patients; follow-up evaluation is needed first unless unstable or clear ectopic is identified.
- Option C (Correct): Serial beta-hCG and repeat ultrasound is standard for pregnancy of unknown location.
- Option D: D&C may be used in select cases when diagnosis remains unclear, but initial step is serial testing.
- Option E: Lack of follow-up risks missed ectopic pregnancy and rupture.

Clinical Pearl: No IUP on TVUS with beta-hCG near the discriminatory zone = pregnancy of unknown location; repeat beta-hCG in 48 hours and repeat TVUS.",premature_closure

IV thrombolysis improves outcomes when given within the time window in eligible patients but increases hemorrhage risk.

Correct Answer Rationale: He presents within the thrombolysis window, but an INR >1.7 is a contraindication to IV alteplase. Therefore, acute management includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) after hemorrhage is excluded, plus secondary prevention measures such as high-intensity statin.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Alteplase is contraindicated with INR >1.7 due to bleeding risk.
- Option B (Correct): Aspirin is appropriate when thrombolysis is contraindicated after CT excludes hemorrhage.
- Option C: Therapeutic heparin is not used acutely for ischemic stroke because it increases hemorrhage risk without clear benefit.
- Option D: LMWH is not indicated for acute stroke treatment.
- Option E: Discharge is unsafe; stroke requires inpatient evaluation and management.

Blood breakdown products in CSF lead to xanthochromia, which persists after the initial bleed.

Correct Answer Rationale: Thunderclap headache with a normal neurologic exam is concerning for SAH. A noncontrast CT can miss SAH, particularly as time from onset increases. When CT is negative but suspicion remains high, lumbar puncture to assess for xanthochromia and RBCs is the next step.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Treating as migraine risks missing a life-threatening SAH.
- Option B (Correct): LP after negative CT is indicated when SAH remains a concern.
- Option C: MRI may detect alternative pathology but is not the standard next test for suspected SAH after negative CT.
- Option D: EEG is not used to diagnose SAH.
- Option E: Steroids do not treat SAH and delay diagnosis.

Therapy targets symptom control (beta-blockade), decreased hormone synthesis (thionamides), and decreased hormone release (iodine) while treating precipitating factors.

Correct Answer Rationale: Thionamides must be given before iodine to block new thyroid hormone synthesis; giving iodine first can provide substrate for hormone production. PTU is often used initially because it also decreases peripheral conversion of T4 to T3; a beta-blocker is used for adrenergic symptoms.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A (Correct): Give thionamide first (PTU), then iodine to block release, plus beta-blocker; add glucocorticoids/supportive care as needed.
- Option B: Iodine before thionamide can worsen hormone synthesis (Jod-Basedow effect).
- Option C: Radioiodine is not an acute therapy and is contraindicated in unstable thyroid storm.
- Option D: Levothyroxine would worsen thyrotoxicosis.
