Early hypovolemia and hemoconcentration can worsen pancreatic ischemia and increase the risk of necrosis.

Correct Answer Rationale: This patient has acute pancreatitis (severe epigastric pain radiating to the back and markedly elevated lipase) with signs of intravascular depletion (hypotension, tachycardia, elevated hematocrit, elevated BUN). Early aggressive isotonic crystalloid (often lactated Ringer) is the key next step to restore perfusion and reduce complications.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Diuretics would worsen hypovolemia and pancreatic hypoperfusion; they are not indicated in early pancreatitis.
- Option B (Correct): Aggressive isotonic crystalloid resuscitation addresses third spacing and improves pancreatic microcirculation in the early phase.
- Option C: CT with contrast is not required to diagnose uncomplicated pancreatitis and is generally reserved for diagnostic uncertainty or suspected complications (eg, necrosis) after 48–72 hours.
- Option D: Routine antibiotics are not indicated in acute pancreatitis unless there is proven infected necrosis or another infection source.
- Option E: ERCP is indicated for gallstone pancreatitis with cholangitis or persistent biliary obstruction; ultrasound here shows no gallstones and a normal bile duct.

Clinical Pearl: Early management of acute pancreatitis is aggressive isotonic IV fluids plus pain control; contrast CT is reserved for complications or unclear diagnosis after 48–72 hours.",premature_closure

The kidney’s tubular function remains intact, producing low FENa and bland urine sediment with hyaline casts.

Correct Answer Rationale: She is hypotensive and clinically volume depleted with an elevated BUN:creatinine ratio, low FENa (0.3%), and high urine osmolality—findings consistent with intact tubular reabsorption and prerenal azotemia.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Acute tubular necrosis typically has higher FENa (>2%), muddy brown granular casts, and less concentrated urine.
- Option B: Acute interstitial nephritis classically presents with fever, rash, eosinophilia, and pyuria/WBC casts; urine indices are not typically prerenal.
- Option C (Correct): Hypotension and volume depletion with low FENa and concentrated urine support prerenal azotemia.
- Option D: Postrenal obstruction often causes hydronephrosis and may show hematuria; urine indices are variable and not classically low FENa with bland sediment early.
- Option E: Contrast nephropathy requires recent iodinated contrast exposure, which is not present.

Calcium salts antagonize the membrane effects of hyperkalemia without changing total body potassium.

Correct Answer Rationale: He has severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes (peaked T waves and QRS widening). The first priority is immediate cardiac membrane stabilization with IV calcium (eg, calcium gluconate), followed by therapies that shift potassium intracellularly and remove potassium from the body.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Insulin/dextrose lowers serum potassium rapidly but should follow membrane stabilization when ECG changes are present.
- Option B (Correct): IV calcium is the immediate step when hyperkalemia causes ECG changes.
- Option C: Cation-exchange resins have delayed onset and are not appropriate for emergent stabilization.
- Option D: Loop diuretics are ineffective in ESRD with minimal urine output.
- Option E: Bicarbonate can shift potassium intracellularly in select acidemic states but is not the first step with ECG changes.

Prompt broad-spectrum antipseudomonal coverage reduces mortality.

Correct Answer Rationale: This patient has febrile neutropenia (ANC <500/µL and fever). He is hemodynamically stable with no clear catheter infection, pneumonia, skin/soft tissue infection, or mucositis. Empiric IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam monotherapy (eg, cefepime) is appropriate initial management.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: This regimen targets typical community-acquired pneumonia pathogens and lacks antipseudomonal coverage.
- Option B: Vancomycin is added when there is suspected catheter infection, skin/soft tissue infection, pneumonia, severe mucositis, or hemodynamic instability; it is not routine in stable patients without these features.
- Option C (Correct): Cefepime provides broad gram-negative coverage including Pseudomonas and is standard empiric therapy for stable febrile neutropenia.
- Option D: TMP-SMX plus steroids is used for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and is not initial empiric therapy for neutropenic fever.
- Option E: Oral outpatient regimens are inappropriate for high-risk neutropenia after induction chemotherapy.

Clinical Pearl: Febrile neutropenia requires immediate IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam (cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, or meropenem); add vancomycin only for specific indications.",base_rate_neglect

In people who inject drugs, right-sided (tricuspid) endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus is common and can cause septic pulmonary emboli.

Correct Answer Rationale: This patient has findings consistent with right-sided infective endocarditis (IV drug use, new tricuspid regurgitation murmur, peripheral stigmata, and cavitary pulmonary nodules suggesting septic emboli). Empiric therapy should cover MRSA until susceptibilities return; vancomycin is appropriate.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A (Correct): Vancomycin provides empiric MRSA coverage for suspected S aureus endocarditis in IV drug users.
- Option B: Ceftriaxone is used for susceptible viridans streptococci and HACEK organisms but does not reliably cover MRSA.
- Option C: Ampicillin-sulbactam lacks reliable MRSA coverage.
- Option D: Nafcillin is appropriate for MSSA once susceptibilities are known; it is not adequate empiric MRSA coverage.
- Option E: Azithromycin does not treat endocarditis and lacks appropriate bactericidal coverage.

Clinical Pearl: IV drug users with suspected endocarditis should receive empiric MRSA-active therapy (vancomycin) after blood cultures are drawn.",availability_heuristic

This produces thrombocytopenia and a paradoxical hypercoagulable state with high risk of venous and arterial thrombosis.

Correct Answer Rationale: The timing (5–10 days after heparin), >50% platelet fall, and new thrombosis strongly suggest HIT. Management is immediate discontinuation of all heparin products and initiation of a non-heparin anticoagulant such as argatroban or bivalirudin.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Platelet transfusion can worsen thrombosis risk in HIT and is reserved for life-threatening bleeding or urgent invasive procedures.
- Option B: Warfarin should be avoided initially because it can precipitate venous limb gangrene in HIT; it is started only after platelets recover and patient is therapeutically anticoagulated with a non-heparin agent.
- Option C (Correct): Stop heparin and anticoagulate with a non-heparin agent to treat thrombosis and prevent progression.
- Option D: Observation is inappropriate because HIT is prothrombotic and can progress rapidly.
- Option E: Aspirin does not adequately treat the thrombotic risk of HIT.

Clinical Pearl: Suspected HIT requires stopping all heparin and starting a non-heparin anticoagulant; delay warfarin until platelets recover.",premature_closure

Uric acid and calcium-phosphate precipitation can cause acute kidney injury and arrhythmias.

Correct Answer Rationale: High-grade lymphomas with large tumor burden are high risk for TLS. Prevention centers on aggressive IV hydration to enhance renal clearance and xanthine oxidase inhibition with allopurinol (or rasburicase in higher-risk or established hyperuricemia) to limit uric acid accumulation.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A (Correct): Hydration plus uric-acid–lowering prophylaxis is first-line TLS prevention.
- Option B: Diuretics are not first-line and can worsen volume depletion if used without adequate hydration.
- Option C: Routine calcium administration is avoided because it can increase calcium-phosphate precipitation; treat symptomatic hypocalcemia only.
- Option D: Antibiotics do not prevent TLS.
- Option E: Dialysis is reserved for severe or refractory electrolyte derangements or renal failure, not routine prophylaxis.

It is a major cause of morbidity and can progress rapidly.

Correct Answer Rationale: He has acute chest syndrome (fever, hypoxemia, and new infiltrate) shortly after a pain crisis. Management requires supplemental oxygen, empiric antibiotics covering typical and atypical pathogens, incentive spirometry, and transfusion (simple transfusion for most; exchange transfusion for severe or rapidly progressive disease).

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Steroids may shorten symptoms but increase rebound pain crises and are not routine first-line therapy.
- Option B (Correct): Combined oxygen, empiric antibiotics, and transfusion treats hypoxemia and addresses infectious triggers.
- Option C: Bronchodilators may help if wheezing/asthma is present but do not address the core pathophysiology.
- Option D: Thrombolysis is for massive pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic compromise; the presentation fits acute chest syndrome.
- Option E: This is a potentially life-threatening complication requiring inpatient management.

Vascular inflammation can reduce blood flow to the optic nerve, causing irreversible vision loss.

Correct Answer Rationale: The combination of age >50, new headache, jaw claudication, elevated inflammatory markers, and visual symptoms is highly suggestive of giant cell arteritis. High-dose glucocorticoids should be started immediately to prevent permanent vision loss; diagnostic confirmation with temporal artery biopsy can follow and remains informative for at least 1–2 weeks after starting steroids.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Biopsy is important for diagnosis but should not delay steroids when vision is threatened.
- Option B (Correct): Immediate high-dose glucocorticoids are indicated in suspected GCA, especially with visual symptoms.
- Option C: NSAIDs are inadequate and risk irreversible complications.
- Option D: Neuroimaging is not the priority given the classic vasculitis features.

Septic arthritis can rapidly destroy cartilage and requires urgent diagnosis and treatment.

Correct Answer Rationale: Fever, leukocytosis, and an acutely hot, swollen joint raise concern for septic arthritis even when gout risk factors are present. Arthrocentesis with synovial fluid cell count, crystal analysis, and Gram stain/culture is required to distinguish septic arthritis from gout and guide therapy.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Empiric gout treatment risks delaying diagnosis of septic arthritis.
- Option B: Serum uric acid can be normal during an acute gout flare and does not exclude septic arthritis.
- Option C (Correct): Joint aspiration is the diagnostic gold standard for acute monoarthritis when infection is possible.
- Option D: MRI does not diagnose gout vs septic arthritis and delays definitive evaluation.

Physical examination shows temperature 39.5°C (103.1°F) and heart rate 140/min. He has bilateral nonexudative conjunctival injection, cracked erythematous lips, and a red tongue. There is a polymorphous maculopapular rash on the trunk, swelling of the hands with erythema of the palms, and a 1.8-cm unilateral cervical lymph node.
Laboratory studies show ESR 82 mm/hr, CRP 12 mg/dL, platelets 486,000/µL, and albumin 2.8 g/dL.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?","[{""label"": ""A"", ""text"": ""Oral amoxicillin for presumed scarlet fever""}, {""label"": ""B"", ""text"": ""Supportive care only; the illness is self-limited""}, {""label"": ""C"", ""text"": ""Intravenous immune globulin plus aspirin therapy""}, {""label"": ""D"", ""text"": ""High-dose glucocorticoids as monotherapy""}, {""label"": ""E"", ""text"": ""Reassurance and follow-up in 2\u20133 days without treatment""}]",C,"Pathophysiology: Kawasaki disease is an acute medium-vessel vasculitis in young children that can involve the coronary arteries. Inflammation can lead to coronary artery aneurysms and thrombosis if untreated.

Correct Answer Rationale: He meets criteria for Kawasaki disease (fever ≥5 days plus conjunctivitis, oral mucosal changes, rash, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy). Treatment with IVIG and aspirin within 10 days of fever onset reduces the risk of coronary artery aneurysms; echocardiography is also obtained but should not delay therapy.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A: Scarlet fever is associated with exudative pharyngitis and sandpaper rash; it does not explain extremity swelling and conjunctivitis.
- Option B: Untreated Kawasaki disease carries significant coronary risk; supportive care alone is insufficient.
- Option C (Correct): IVIG plus aspirin is standard therapy to prevent coronary complications.
- Option D: Steroids may be added in refractory/high-risk cases but are not first-line monotherapy.
- Option E: Delaying treatment increases risk of coronary aneurysms.

Clinical Pearl: Kawasaki disease is treated with IVIG plus aspirin within 10 days of fever onset to prevent coronary artery aneurysms.",base_rate_neglect
