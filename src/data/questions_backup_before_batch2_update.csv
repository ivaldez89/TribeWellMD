Profound volume depletion (5-7L deficit) occurs via osmotic diuresis as glucose exceeds the renal threshold and pulls water into urine. Hypovolemia causes prerenal AKI, tissue hypoperfusion, and impaired insulin delivery. Volume resuscitation must precede insulin therapy because insulin drives potassium intracellularly, and hypokalemia in volume-depleted patients can cause fatal arrhythmias.

Distractor Analysis: (A) Regular insulin IV bolus first: Insulin before fluids risks severe hypokalemia as K+ shifts intracellularly; the initial K+ of 5.4 mEq/L will plummet without adequate volume and potassium repletion. (C) Sodium bicarbonate: Bicarbonate is only indicated for pH <6.9 or life-threatening hyperkalemia; it does not address the underlying pathophysiology and may worsen intracellular acidosis. (D) Potassium chloride first: Though total body K+ is depleted, serum K+ is 5.4 mEq/L due to transcellular shifts; potassium replacement begins after K+ falls below 5.3 mEq/L. (E) Subcutaneous insulin: Subcutaneous absorption is unreliable in hypovolemic patients with poor peripheral perfusion; IV insulin with continuous monitoring is required.

Distractor Analysis: (A) Methimazole first: Thionamides block new hormone synthesis but do not affect already-circulating T3/T4; they take weeks for full effect and do not address acute cardiovascular crisis. (C) Potassium iodide first: Iodide blocks hormone release (Wolff-Chaikoff effect) but should be given 1 hour AFTER thionamides to prevent iodide from serving as substrate for more hormone synthesis. (D) Dexamethasone first: Glucocorticoids block peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion and treat possible relative adrenal insufficiency, but do not address immediate cardiac decompensation.

Hypotension with orthostasis reflects mineralocorticoid deficiency (sodium wasting and volume depletion). Hyperpigmentation occurs because loss of cortisol feedback increases ACTH secretion, and ACTH shares a precursor (POMC) with melanocyte-stimulating hormone.

Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) is characterized by severe hyperglycemia (>600 mg/dL), hyperosmolality (>320 mOsm/kg), and minimal ketosis. Unlike DKA, patients retain enough insulin to prevent lipolysis but not enough to control glucose. The profound dehydration (average 8-10 L deficit) results from osmotic diuresis. Initial management prioritizes aggressive isotonic fluid resuscitation to restore intravascular volume and tissue perfusion before addressing hyperglycemia.

Distractor Analysis:

(A) IV regular insulin bolus: Incorrect. Fluid resuscitation alone significantly lowers glucose in HHS. Insulin is started later at lower doses (0.025-0.05 units/kg/hr) to prevent cerebral edema from rapid osmotic shifts.
(B) IV 0.45% saline at 250 mL/hr: Incorrect. Hypotonic saline is inappropriate in hypotensive patients. Isotonic fluid is required first to restore perfusion; 0.45% saline may be used later based on corrected sodium.
(D) D5 with 0.45% saline: Incorrect. Dextrose-containing fluids are added when glucose reaches 250-300 mg/dL, not with initial glucose of 928 mg/dL.
(E) Subcutaneous long-acting insulin: Incorrect. Critically ill patients require IV insulin for precise titration; subcutaneous absorption is unpredictable in hypovolemia.

Pheochromocytoma causes episodic catecholamine release producing the classic triad of headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis. Preoperative alpha-blockade with phenoxybenzamine (irreversible alpha-1 antagonist) is mandatory to prevent intraoperative hypertensive crisis during tumor manipulation. Alpha-blockade also allows intravascular volume expansion, as chronic catecholamine excess causes vasoconstriction and relative hypovolemia. Beta-blockade is added 2-3 days later to control reflex tachycardia.

Distractor Analysis:

(A) Propranolol followed by phenoxybenzamine: Incorrect. Beta-blockade before alpha-blockade causes unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, leading to severe hypertensive crisis.
(C) Propranolol alone: Incorrect. Same dangerous mechanism—allows unopposed alpha vasoconstriction without adequate blood pressure control.
(D) Labetalol alone: Incorrect. Although labetalol has both alpha and beta effects, its beta effects predominate and do not provide reliable alpha-blockade for pheochromocytoma.
(E) Proceed directly to surgery: Incorrect. Historical mortality from unblocked pheochromocytoma surgery was extremely high due to intraoperative hypertensive crisis and cardiovascular collapse.

Myxedema coma represents decompensated severe hypothyroidism with altered mental status, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and hypoventilation.

(A) Oral levothyroxine: Incorrect. Oral administration is inappropriate in obtunded patients with GI hypomotility; absorption is unreliable.
(B) IV levothyroxine alone: Incorrect. Missing crucial glucocorticoid coverage risks precipitating adrenal crisis when thyroid hormone accelerates cortisol metabolism.

Burkitt lymphoma is among the highest TLS-risk malignancies due to rapid cell turnover. This patient has multiple high-risk features: bulky disease, elevated LDH (tumor burden marker), and elevated baseline uric acid. Rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) rapidly converts existing uric acid to allantoin within hours, preventing uric acid nephropathy. Allopurinol only prevents new uric acid formation and takes days to work.

Distractor Analysis:

(B) Allopurinol and IV hydration only: Incorrect. Allopurinol blocks xanthine oxidase but does not break down existing uric acid. Takes days to lower levels—inadequate for high-risk patients with already elevated uric acid.
(C) Sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize urine: Incorrect. Urine alkalinization was historically used but is now discouraged—increases calcium phosphate precipitation, which is more dangerous than uric acid crystals.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the leading cause of death in sickle cell disease, defined as new pulmonary infiltrate plus fever, chest pain, respiratory symptoms, or hypoxia. This patient has SEVERE ACS: significant hypoxia (88%), hemoglobin drop >1.5 g/dL, tachypnea, and low reticulocyte count (suggesting bone marrow suppression). Exchange transfusion rapidly decreases HbS percentage to <30% while preventing hyperviscosity.

Distractor Analysis:

(A) Simple blood transfusion to Hgb 10: Incorrect. Simple transfusion raises hemoglobin but doesn't reduce HbS as effectively as exchange transfusion. For severe ACS, exchange transfusion is preferred. Also, target Hgb is 10, not higher, to avoid hyperviscosity.
(C) Supplemental oxygen and incentive spirometry only: Incorrect. Supportive measures are needed but inadequate alone for severe ACS. Transfusion is the priority.
(D) Bronchoscopy with BAL: Incorrect. May be considered if unusual pathogen suspected but not first-line. Empiric antibiotics appropriate.
(E) Increase morphine dose: Incorrect. Excessive opioids cause hypoventilation and atelectasis, worsening ACS. Pain control important but should use multimodal approach.

Clinical Pearl: Severe ACS (significant hypoxia, hemoglobin drop, tachypnea, multilobar involvement) requires exchange transfusion to rapidly reduce HbS%. Simple transfusion acceptable for mild ACS. Always add antibiotics covering typical and atypical pathogens.",,active

Both present with acute hot swollen joint but have fundamentally different management: septic arthritis requires urgent drainage and IV antibiotics, while crystal arthritis responds to anti-inflammatory therapy.

Distractor Analysis: (A) Empiric antibiotics without arthrocentesis treats blindly without confirming the diagnosis; if crystal arthropathy is present, antibiotics are unnecessary and delay proper treatment. (B) Prednisone for presumed gout may be correct if crystals are seen, but initiating anti-inflammatory therapy without excluding infection in a febrile patient with leukocytosis is dangerous.

Closed-loop obstruction and strangulation are surgical emergencies requiring immediate intervention.

Distractor Analysis: (A) Immediate exploratory laparotomy may be required for complete obstruction with peritonitis or strangulation but is not first-line for partial SBO or early complete obstruction without signs of ischemia.

Colchicine works synergistically with NSAIDs by inhibiting microtubule assembly in inflammatory cells and has been shown in the COPE and ICAP trials to reduce recurrence rates from ~30% to ~15%.

Distractor Analysis: (A) Increase ibuprofen to 800 mg three times daily: He is already on therapeutic dosing (600 mg TID = 1800 mg/day); the issue is mechanism of resistance, not dose inadequacy. Higher doses increase GI bleeding risk without addressing refractory inflammation. (C) Switch to prednisone 0.5 mg/kg daily: Corticosteroids should be avoided in acute pericarditis as first-line escalation because they paradoxically increase recurrence risk and prolong disease course. They are reserved for contraindications to NSAIDs/colchicine or autoimmune etiologies. (D) Add colchicine and prednisone simultaneously: Adding steroids when colchicine alone would suffice increases recurrence risk and causes unnecessary steroid side effects. The correct approach is stepwise escalation. (E) Obtain pericardiocentesis for diagnostic evaluation: Pericardiocentesis is indicated for cardiac tamponade or suspected purulent pericarditis; this patient has a trivial effusion without tamponade, making drainage unnecessary and potentially harmful.
